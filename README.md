# Predicting Customer Churn in a Telecom Company using the Telco Customer Churn Dataset

## Introduction
In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model that can predict customer churn in a telecom company using the Telco Customer Churn Dataset. By analyzing customer demographics, service usage patterns, and other relevant features, we will build a model to identify potential churners and help the company take proactive measures to retain customers.

## Dataset Description

Source: Kaggle <br/>
Size: 7,043 instances, 21 features <br/>
Link: [Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) <br/>
## Objectives
* Perform data exploration to gain insights into the dataset.
* Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numeric features.
* Build a machine learning model to predict customer churn using algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests.
* Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters using techniques like cross-validation and grid search.
* Interpret the model results to identify the key factors contributing to customer churn.
* Optional: Develop a user-friendly interface for stakeholders to input customer information and obtain churn predictions.
